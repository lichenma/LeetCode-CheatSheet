Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 

Given a string find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

Example
Input: 		"abcabcbb"
Output:		3
Explanation:	The answer is "abc", with the length of 3

Input:		"bbbbb"
Output:		1
Explanation:	The answer is "b", with the length of 1

Input:		"pwwkew"
Output:		3
Explanation: 	The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring
		"pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring

Approach 1: Brute Force 
Checking all the substrings one by one to see if it has no duplicate character 

Algorithm 


Suppose we have a function "boolean allUnique(String substring)" which returns true if all the
characters in the substring are unique and false otherwise. We can iterate through all the possible 
substrings of the given string s and call the function allUnique. If it turns out to be true, then we 
update our answer of the maximum length of substring without duplicate characters. 

To enumerate all substrings of a given string we enumerate the start and end indices of them. Suppose
the start and end indices are i and j respectively. Then we have 0 <= i <= j <= n. Thus using two 
nested loops with i from 0 to n-1 and j from i+1 to n, we can enumerate all the substrings of s

To check if one string has duplicate characters we can use a set. We iterate through all the 
characters in the string and put them into the set one by one. Before putting one character, we check
if the set already contains it. If so we return false and after the loop we return true.





public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++)
                if (allUnique(s, i, j)) ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
        return ans;
    }

    public boolean allUnique(String s, int start, int end) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            Character ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (set.contains(ch)) return false;
            set.add(ch);
        }
        return true;
    }
}


Complexity Analysis 

Time Complexity:   O(n^3)	Verifying if characters in [i,j) are unique requires us to scan all of
				them which would cost O(j-i) time. 

				For a given i, the sum of time costed by each j -> [i+1,n] is 
				"Summation from i+1 to n O(j-1)"

				Thus, the sum of all the time consumption is: 
				O(summation from 0 to n-1(summation from j=i+1 to n (j-1))) 
				O(summation from i=0 to n-1(1+n-i)(n-i)/2)) = O(n^3)


				*Note that the sum of all numbers up to n 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2


Space Complexity:  O(min(n,m))	We require O(k) space for checking a substring has no duplicate 
				characters, where k is the size of the set. The size of the Set is 
				upper bounded by the size of the string n amd the size of the charset
				or alphabet m

Approach 2: Sliding Window 




A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems. A window is a range of 
elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices

ex. [i,j) left-closed, right-open

A sliding window is a window that slides its two boundaries in a certain direction, for example if we
slide [i,j) to the right by 1 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1) - left closed, right open.



Sliding Window approach, whenever we are looking at a section on an array usual to perform calculations
we don't need to completely recalculate everything for every section of the array. Usually we can use
the value obtained from another section of the array to determine something about this section of the 
array. For example if we are calculating the sum of sections of an array we can use the previously 
calculated value of a section to determine the sum of an adjacent section in the array. 

Ex 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

If we calculate the first section of four values we get 1+2+3+4= 10, then to calculate the next section
2+3+4+5 we can just take our first section (window_sum) and perform the operation: 

window_sum-first entry + last entry = 10-1+5= 14

So essentially for the window sliding technique we use what we know about an existing window to 
determine properties for another window. 





Algorithm

In the brute force approach, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate characters but
this is unnecessary. If a substring from index i to j-1 is already checked to have no duplicate 
characters we only need to check if s[j] is already in the substring. 

To check if a character is already in the substring we can scan the substring which leads to an O(n^2)
algorithm but we can improve on this runtime using a HashSet as a sliding window to check if a 
character exists in the current set O(1). 

We use a HashSet to store the characters in the current window [i,j) and then we slide the index j to
the right, if it is not in the HashSet, we slide j further until s[j] is already in the HashSet. At
this point we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters starting with index i.
If we do this for all i, then we obtain our answer. 




public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int ans = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < n) {
            // try to extend the range [i, j]
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))){
                set.add(s.charAt(j++));
                ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
            }
            else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}



Complexity Analysis

Time complexity:	O(2n)=O(n)	Worst case each character will be visited twice by i and j

Space complexity: 	O(min(m,n))	Same as the brute force method, we need O(k) space for the 
					sliding window where k is the size of the set. The size of the
					set is bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the
					charset/alphabet m 





//===================================================================================================//

Approach 3: Sliding Window Optimized

The previously discussed sliding window approach requires at most 2n steps and this could in fact be
optimized even further to require only n steps. Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or
not, we could define a mapping of the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters 
immediately when we found a repeated character 

If s[j] has a duplicate in the range [i,j) with index j', we don't need to increase i little be little
we can just skip all the elements in the range [i,j'] and let i be j'+1 directly

        for (int j = 0, i = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)), i);
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
